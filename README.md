The BDOT_GESUT plugin is intended for Polish surveyors and employees of the geodetic and cartographic service.

The BDOT_GESUT plugin is designed to transfer a QGIS project to a TurboMAP project using user interface automation.

At the same time, a large number of algorithms implemented for QGIS become available in TurboMAP projects.
In particular, it is the Spatial data processing framework for QGIS, CAD and AI tools.

The appearance of conventional signs of objects and maps created in the QGIS project using the BDOT_GESUT plugin 
meets the requirements of the Decree of the Minister of Development, 
Labor and Technology of July 27, 2021 on the register of land and buildings 
(https://isap.sejm.gov.pl/ isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20210001390).

Objects and their appearance are stored in SHP/DBF and QML formats.
